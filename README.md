## Requirements ##

* Curl Extension
* JSON encode/decode Extension

## Installing ##

PHP-WowApi uses the autoloading features of PHP and works with most of the major frameworks. To load the library manually you can use the following code, you will need to change the base path depending on where you store the library:

``` php
<?php
//Path relative to this file
spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
    //Path relative to this file
    $dir = __DIR__ .'/lib/';
    $file = $dir . strtr($class, '\\', '/') . '.php';
    if (file_exists($file)) {
        require $file;
        return true;
    }
});
```

## How To Use ##

To use the library you must first create an instance of the the Client class. Because this library supports multiple request adaptors you will need to pass the client class an instance of a request adaptor. Currently the only adaptor available is the Curl adaptor.

When using in a loop or long running program, be sure to unset both $api and $request after you are done with them and before using them for another character, or memory usage will continue to increase.

``` php
<?php
use WowApi\Client;
use WowApi\Request\Curl;

$request = new Curl();
$api = new Client();
$api->setRequest($request);
```
